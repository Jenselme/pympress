# About
The special thing is that it is designed to be a dual-screen PDF reader used during presentations and public talks. If you need to make a presentation using your laptop and an overhead projector, you may well like it. You will have your presentation fullscreen on the projector, and at the same time some useful data on your laptop screen: a view of the current slide, a thumbnail of the next one, a clock, and a time counter indicating for how long you have been talking.

pympress is a free software, distributed under the terms of the GPL license (version 2 or, at your option, any later version).
